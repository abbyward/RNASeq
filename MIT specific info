# Since the files are huge, it's important to get access to the Luria Linux cluster (super easy just email luria-help@mit.edu)
ssh {kerberos id}@luria.mit.edu
  #enter your laptop password

# Most of the work should be done in a computing node, so run the following 
srun --pty --mem=4G -c 4 bash

# Then copy the raw data from a hard drive; the first part should be the pathfile of the drive, the second the new directory in the cluster
scp -r "/Volumes/One Touch/my_data" award01@luria.mit.edu:/home/award01/data
